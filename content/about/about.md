# Hello ðŸ‘‹

**Welcome to my personal website !**

My name is *Arthur*, better known under the nickname ``Vozec`` and I am passionate about computer science, more precisely about _cybersecurity_. I learn new things in autodidacts in parallel to my post-baccalaureate studies and this GitHub contains many projects that I did by myself. I participate to many **CTF** and many of the new tools I create allow me to save time during these competitions.

## Here is a list of all the tools I have so far published :

- ### ðŸ”’ Cryptography ðŸ”“
  - [Feal ALL](https://github.com/Vozec/Feal-ALL): This tool is the python implementation of the 3 versions of FEAL encryption
  - [AES DFA](https://github.com/Vozec/AES-DFA): An implementation of a differential fault analysis on AES 128
  - [AES Square Attack](https://github.com/Vozec/AES-Square-Attack): An implementation of the Square-Attack on an AES-128
  - [AES Flipper](https://github.com/Vozec/AES-Flipper): An implementation of an AES CBC BitFlip attack
  - [AES ECB Padding attack](https://github.com/Vozec/AES-ECB-Padding-attack): An implementation of a padding attack on AES with ECB mode
  - [AES CBC Padding attack](https://github.com/Vozec/AES-CBC-Padding-attack): An implementation of a padding attack on AES with CBC mode
  - [RSA PKCS1.5 Padding attack](https://github.com/Vozec/RSA-Padding-Oracle) : An implementation of the Bleichenbacher's attack on RSA PKCS1.5 padding
  - [AES Sage 128](https://github.com/Vozec/AES-Sage-128): An implementation of a classic AES-128 using Rijndael-GF from SageMath  
  - [Cryptolib](https://github.com/Vozec/Cryptolib): My own cryptography library
  - [DLP Solver](https://github.com/Vozec/DLP-Solver): A tool to solve the discrete logarithm problem with several algorithms
  - [Facto4CTF](https://github.com/Vozec/Facto4CTF): A tool to factor RSA public keys with multiple methods
  - [Vigenere Plaintext Attack](https://github.com/Vozec/Vigenere-Plaintext-Attack): A simple tool to break the vigenÃ¨re cipher with a Well known plaintext

- ### ðŸ”¨ Reverse Engineering ðŸ”¨
  - [BrainDbg](https://github.com/Vozec/BrainDbg): My Own Brainfuck debugger in python
  - [RevBrain](https://github.com/Vozec/RevBrain): A tool to automate crack resolution in CTF
